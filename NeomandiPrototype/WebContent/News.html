            <pre>Our Bangalore
19 August 2016
Startup of the week.
Arvind GR</pre>
            <p align="justify">
                In 2014, the number of farmers who committed suicide in Karnataka, according to the National Crime Records Bureau of India, was 1,875. Being the third highest in the country, it has been a graver issue than any natural calamity affecting the region. Farmer suicides, according to a survey by TATA institute, cited "government apathy, the absence of a safety net for farmers, and lack of access to information related to agriculture as the chief causes for the desperate condition of farmers in the state." While there have been new initiatives and policies of the government to reduce the abuse of farmers by agents and middle men, there appears to be no change in the way the farmers get looted. According to Aravinda Kumar, the founder of NeoMandi.com, an online auctioning platform for Agricultural Produce, Market Yard & Logistics Support, there is a huge lobby in the market yard among the traders and the middle men, owing to which farmers often get back from the APMCs with very less income after selling their produce. The only way ahead, he feels, is going transparent and going online. With the introduction of their online platform NeoMandi, Aravinda and the other co-founders Narendra, Naveen Kumar, Prashanth Kumar and Sunil Kumar Gowda are creating an ecosystem of e-auction platform, e-payment, logistics support, state of the art scientific storages, grading and pre-market value addition facilities, in the form of market yards. Hailing from the villages around Chikkabalapur, these young entrepreneurs felt the need to help farmers across India. That is when the idea of Neo Mandi struck, and then they headed towards our city to join other start ups.
            </p>

            <h3>What is NeoMandi?</h3>

            <p align="justify">
                Neo Mandi is a private Agricultural Produce Market Committee that will take auctioning of whole sale agro produces online and bridge the gap between the trader and the farmer. Though this gap is currently filled by the broker lobby, NeoMandi is making efforts to make the entire transaction transparent and the process less complicated.
            </p>

            <h3>How NeoMandi works for farmers?</h3>

            <p align="justify">
                The farmer raises a request to sell his produce on the NeoMandi website, or simply calls them on their toll free number. The team then reaches out to the farmer and transports his/her produce to their nearest market yard. In the market yard, the produce is assayed for the quality and graded accordingly by quality professionals and a unique lot number is provided to the farmer. The lot number along with images of the produce will then be displayed on Neo Mandi's electronic auction platform. Traders from all over the country will participate in the electronic auction, which ends at a stipulated time for a given lot. The best price is brought to the notice of the farmer on whose concurrence the price is finalized. This entire process happens under the watch of the farmer through the smart phone app. Farmers receive money for the auctioned produce after a deduction of service charges into their bank account. Aravinda says, "This platform is a quintessential need for this generation'sfarmer. Almost every family in village today owns a smart phone. Then why not put it to some good use. This is why NeoMandi was started." As a company, NeoMandi is aiming to be a billion dollar start up. "Well this is a 100 billion dollar market that we are concerned with. Keeping in mind the vastness of the agricultural industry with 60% of us being directly or indirectly depended on it, we would like to achieve the target of being a unicorn start up by 2020," he says. Bangalore, being the IT capital of India, has influenced the culture across the country in many ways. It surely has showed these entrepreneurs from Chikkabalapur, the need for something like NeoMandi. "The ecosystem for startups here is just brilliant. We get to interact with many of them and get our issues resolved. And at the same time, help out others when needed. If the spirit of bringing up start ups help every bit our society, then it surly is a beautiful place to be," says Aravinda. While the challenges NeoMandi faces are many, Aravinda feels that, its crossing these hurdles that could put NeoMandi on the success curve.
