<h1>How Neomandi Works For A Farmer?</h1>

<p>
When a farmer needs to sell his produce, he/she raises a requirement on our website or simply calls us on our toll free number. Our team on the fixed day reaches out to the farmer and transports his/her produce to our nearest market yard.
In the market yard, the produce is assayed for the quality and graded accordingly by our quality team and a unique lot number is provided to the farmer. Once this is done, the lot number along with images of the produce will be logged in to our electronic auction platform. Farmer is assisted throughout this process by our farmer help desk team.
Now, the traders from all over the country participate in the electronic auction and auction ends at a stipulated time for a given lot. The best price is brought to the notice of the farmer and on his/her concurrence the price is finalized. This entire process can also be seen by farmer on an app in his/her smartphone. The final price is disseminated to the farmer on the app/SMS/e-mail. Farmer receives his/her money for the auctioned produce, after deduction of the platform and other service charges, directly into his/her bank account.
