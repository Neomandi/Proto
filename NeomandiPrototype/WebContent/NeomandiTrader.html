<h1>How Neomandi Works For A Trader?</h1>
<p align = "justify">
As a need arises for a trader to procure a produce for his/her business, the trader logs in to the electronic auction platform via a desktop/smartphone and searches for the kind of produce he/she needs. When a suitable lot is found on the platform, reviews the quality information of the lot and he/she starts bidding in a competitive auction.
The platform simultaneously displays the final price of the produce taking into account the transportation and handling charges which should be paid by the trader. This allows him/her to make an informed revision of the bidding price.
On winning over the auction, after concurrence from the selling farmer, the total cost of the produce won by the trader is deducted from his/her bank account and after deducting the platform and other service charges, will be transferred to farmer's bank account. The trade details of the day are disseminated to the trader on the app/SMS/e-mail.
Our team ships the procured produce of the trader to his/her shop/warehouse's doorsteps. During the transportation, the trader is constantly informed about the location of the vehicle and expected date and time of delivery on the app/SMS/e-mail. This reduces the hassles of finding the transportation and procurement for trader making his/her life easier and helps in making an intelligent business decision.
