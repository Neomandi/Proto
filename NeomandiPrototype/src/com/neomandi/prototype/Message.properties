nmfarmer.p1=When a farmer needs to sell his produce, he/she raises a requirement on our website or simply calls us on our toll free number. Our team on the fixed day reaches out to the farmer and transports his/her produce to our nearest market yard. In the market yard, the produce is assayed for the quality and graded accordingly by our quality team and a unique lot number is provided to the farmer. Once this is done, the lot number along with images of the produce will be logged in to our electronic auction platform. Farmer is assisted throughout this process by our farmer help desk team. Now, the traders from all over the country participate in the electronic auction and auction ends at a stipulated time for a given lot. The best price is brought to the notice of the farmer and on his/her concurrence the price is finalized. This entire process can also be seen by farmer on an app in his/her smartphone. The final price is disseminated to the farmer on the app/SMS/e-mail. Farmer receives his/her money for the auctioned produce, after deduction of the platform and other service charges, directly into his/her bank account.
nmtrader.p1=As a need arises for a trader to procure a produce for his/her business, the trader logs in to the electronic auction platform via a desktop/smartphone and searches for the kind of produce he/she needs. When a suitable lot is found on the platform, reviews the quality information of the lot and he/she starts bidding in a competitive auction. The platform simultaneously displays the final price of the produce taking into account the transportation and handling charges which should be paid by the trader. This allows him/her to make an informed revision of the bidding price. On winning over the auction, after concurrence from the selling farmer, the total cost of the produce won by the trader is deducted from his/her bank account and after deducting the platform and other service charges, will be transferred to farmer's bank account. The trade details of the day are disseminated to the trader on the app/SMS/e-mail. Our team ships the procured produce of the trader to his/her shop/warehouse's doorsteps. During the transportation, the trader is constantly informed about the location of the vehicle and expected date and time of delivery on the app/SMS/e-mail. This reduces the hassles of finding the transportation and procurement for trader making his/her life easier and helps in making an intelligent business decision.
news.p1=Our Bangalore 19 August 2016 Startup of the week. Arvind GR
news.p2=In 2014, the number of farmers who committed suicide in Karnataka, according to the National Crime Records Bureau of India, was 1,875. Being the third highest in the country, it has been a graver issue than any natural calamity affecting the region. Farmer suicides, according to a survey by TATA institute, cited "government apathy, the absence of a safety net for farmers, and lack of access to information related to agriculture as the chief causes for the desperate condition of farmers in the state." While there have been new initiatives and policies of the government to reduce the abuse of farmers by agents and middle men, there appears to be no change in the way the farmers get looted. According to Aravinda Kumar, the founder of NeoMandi.com, an online auctioning platform for Agricultural Produce, Market Yard & Logistics Support, there is a huge lobby in the market yard among the traders and the middle men, owing to which farmers often get back from the APMCs with very less income after selling their produce. The only way ahead, he feels, is going transparent and going online. With the introduction of their online platform NeoMandi, Aravinda and the other co-founders Narendra, Naveen Kumar, Prashanth Kumar and Sunil Kumar Gowda are creating an ecosystem of e-auction platform, e-payment, logistics support, state of the art scientific storages, grading and pre-market value addition facilities, in the form of market yards. Hailing from the villages around Chikkabalapur, these young entrepreneurs felt the need to help farmers across India. That is when the idea of Neo Mandi struck, and then they headed towards our city to join other start ups.
news.h3=What is NeoMandi?
news.p3=Neo Mandi is a private Agricultural Produce Market Committee that will take auctioning of whole sale agro produces online and bridge the gap between the trader and the farmer. Though this gap is currently filled by the broker lobby, NeoMandi is making efforts to make the entire transaction transparent and the process less complicated.
news.h31=How NeoMandi works for farmers?
news.p4=The farmer raises a request to sell his produce on the NeoMandi website, or simply calls them on their toll free number. The team then reaches out to the farmer and transports his/her produce to their nearest market yard. In the market yard, the produce is assayed for the quality and graded accordingly by quality professionals and a unique lot number is provided to the farmer. The lot number along with images of the produce will then be displayed on Neo Mandi's electronic auction platform. Traders from all over the country will participate in the electronic auction, which ends at a stipulated time for a given lot. The best price is brought to the notice of the farmer on whose concurrence the price is finalized. This entire process happens under the watch of the farmer through the smart phone app. Farmers receive money for the auctioned produce after a deduction of service charges into their bank account. Aravinda says, "This platform is a quintessential need for this generation'sfarmer. Almost every family in village today owns a smart phone. Then why not put it to some good use. This is why NeoMandi was started." As a company, NeoMandi is aiming to be a billion dollar start up. "Well this is a 100 billion dollar market that we are concerned with. Keeping in mind the vastness of the agricultural industry with 60% of us being directly or indirectly depended on it, we would like to achieve the target of being a unicorn start up by 2020," he says. Bangalore, being the IT capital of India, has influenced the culture across the country in many ways. It surely has showed these entrepreneurs from Chikkabalapur, the need for something like NeoMandi. "The ecosystem for startups here is just brilliant. We get to interact with many of them and get our issues resolved. And at the same time, help out others when needed. If the spirit of bringing up start ups help every bit our society, then it surly is a beautiful place to be," says Aravinda. While the challenges NeoMandi faces are many, Aravinda feels that, its crossing these hurdles that could put NeoMandi on the success curve.
